	<p>To LoanMe:</p>


	<p>Please accept this letter and the attached resume as my sincere interest in the Full Stack Web Developer position in your company. 
		I am a recent graduate from University of California, Irvine with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science.
		 I am interested in this position because I enjoy creating new tools and solving problems, which is the essence of software development.
	</p>

	<p>As of now, applying as a newly graduate, I acknowledge my lack of experience. However, I have the ability to learn new technology quickly.
		 In my internship experience, I always explored resources by myself first before asking others for help.
		  Most of the time I was able to pick up some new technologies and solve the current problem.
		 I can take pride in my work this way as well as train myself to become an independent problem solver. 
	</p>

	<p>I believe my education and dedication will be an asset to your organization. Please feel free to connect me on LinkedIn and contact me for any questions or to schedule an interview.</p>

	<p>
		Thank you for your time.<br/>
		Sincerely,<br/>
		Yat Man, Wong
	</p>
